## Liquids

A `liquid` is an identifier naming a location.  Like a variable, a liquid can be mutated.  Contrary to variable assignments, assignments to liquids are pure in that the assignments are not exposed through `call/cc` as the following example shows.

### Example

Consider the following definition of an accumulation procedure that takes a mapper and a list and should return the sum of the values of applying the mapper to each list element:

```scheme
(define (accumulate mapper ls)
  (let ((count 0))
    (for-each 
     (lambda (el)
       (set! count (+ count (mapper el))))
     ls)
    count))
```

(This example is not to show good programming style; for Scheme lists one would use `fold` instead of `for-each`, so think of a sequence type for which a `for-each` but not a `fold` is defined.)

The procedure `accumulate` should be pure procedure but it isn't.  Through capturing a continuation during the dynamic extent of a call to `mapper`, the mutation of `count`, which should be an implementation detail, can be exposed.

A correct implementation for `accumulate` uses liquids instead of variables:

```scheme
(define (accumulate mapper ls)
  (let-liquid ((count 0))
    (for-each 
     (lambda (el)
       (set! count (+ count (mapper el))))
     ls)
    count))
```

### Library name

`(liquid)`

### Binding constructs

`(let-liquid ((LIQUID INIT) ...) BODY)`

The `INIT`s are evaluated in the current environment (in some unspecified order), the `LIQUID`s are bound to fresh locations holding the results, the `BODY` is evaluated in the extended environment, and the values of the last expression of `BODY` are returned.  Each binding of a `LIQUID` has `BODY` as its region. 

Within the dynamic extent of the evaluation of `BODY`, capturing a continuation also captures the current values of the `LIQUID`s and restores them when the continuation is reinstated.

### Syntax

`LIQUID`

An expression consisting of a liquid is a liquid reference.  The value of the liquid reference is the value stored in the location to which the liquid is bound.

`(set! LIQUID EXPRESSION)`

The EXPRESSION is evaluated, and the resulting value is stored in the location to which LIQUID is bound.

`(liquid-let ((LIQUID EXPRESSION) ...) BODY)`

The `INIT`s are evaluated (in some unspecified order), the resulting values are then stored in the locations to which the `LIQUID`s are bound, the `BODY` is evaluated, the previous values of the `LIQUID`s are restored, and the values of the last expression `BODY` are returned.

Within the dynamic extent of the evaluation of `BODY`, capturing a continuation also captures the current values of the `LIQUID`s and restores them when the continuation is reinstated.

### Definitions

`(define-liquid LIQUID EXPRESSION)`

`LIQUID` is bound to a location whose initial value is given by `EXPRESSION`.
