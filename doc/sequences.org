* Sequences

The ~(sequence)~ library provides a set of operations on a sequence.
A /sequence/ is a data structure that is a finite or infinite list of
entries.  Each entry is represented by multiple Scheme values.

To be precise, a sequence is either empty or it has a /head/ and a
/tail/.  The head is represented by multiple Scheme values and the
tail is again a sequence.  The entries of a sequence are defined as
follows: The empty sequence has no entries.  A non-empty sequence has
as its entries its head and the entries of its tail.  This defines an
order on the entries of a sequence.

Most sequences in practice are single-valued, which are sequences
where each entry is represented by a single Scheme value.
